### Notice:
This folder contains all files necessary to produce the ITX-Llama board from JLCPCB, or to continue development of the board.  
However, I don't give any guarantees that everything is correct and working; you need to have a good understanding of Kicad and the PCB/assembly ordering process - and check everything yourself.
